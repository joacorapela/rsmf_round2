\subsection{Support to UK research}

Bonsai is a visual reactive programming that can and has been used in a wide variety of
domains, such as artistic performances and virtual guides to museums. However,
in recent years the development of Bonsai has focused on experimental
neuroscience.

Currently Bonsai is used at multiple neuroscience research laboratories.  Just
to mention a few, it is used at the by more than ten research groups at the
Sainsbury Welcome Centre; it is used at the Institute for Behavioural
Neuroscience where Prof.  Aman Saleem created the popular BonVision package; it
is also used at the Cortex Lab and Coen Lab. All the previous research group
are part of University College London (UCL). Beyond UCL, Bonsai is used by the Kinetic
Cognition Lab at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, and at the Znamenskiy
Lab at the Francis Crick Institute.
